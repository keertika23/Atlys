**Required Tasks:** 

1. Your carousel has to behave exactly like we have on the app. I.e. when you pan around, the tiles should move along. Don’t just implement a swipe gesture implementation.
    1. Specifically if you scroll slowly, it should behave very smoothly. No erratic behaviour.
2. It’s paginated i.e. when you lift your finger it should center to the nearest tile.
3. There should NOT be any space between the cards.
4. The image in the middle should zoom as it comes to the center.
5. The images should zoom in and out keeping the aspect ratio intact.
6. You can use any inbuilt views but no third-party libraries.
7. You don’t need to add country labels or anything, just use any images you like. Still add some rounding to the images so it looks something like this. 
8. The default height of the carousel view can be around 250 points and carousel items have to be of 1:1 aspect ratio. 
9. The height should not be fixed. Which means I were to add some fixed height views at the top and bottom the carousel view should resize itself (i.e., make itself smaller). 
10. In continuation to the above, the view should not overlap any view at the top and bottom if they are added. 
11. You can assume that the carousel view will always occupy the full width of the screen. 
12. When the view appears on the screen, the middle image should be visible on the screen and zoomed-in. 
13. The carousel view should be easily extensible i.e., if were to add 4 more images to it, it should not take more than 15 mins.
